## AUTOMATED ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
A system that aids in taking attendance of students by using QR code. Over the years the manual attendance has been carried across most of educational institutions. To overcome the problems of manual attendance, we have developed “AAS-Tracker” which is a web app that deals with the management of student’s attendance in details. The focus of the app is to track the classroom attendance/absence of students through qr code scanning instead of paper-based methods. In this way, the instructor saves a lot of time and insures no cheating relating to attendance happens. 
The website automates the whole process of keeping track of attendance for every session to keeping track of students who are missing class too often. 
The system facilitates the end users with interactive design and automated processing of attendance management.
